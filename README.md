# intro and purpose

Water for all - for a better world.

Current decision making around water distribution is hindered by politics, local interests, and lobby groups - often disregarding the interest of the majority and the welfare of future generations.

AquaDAO is coming to the rescue.

AquaDAO provides the platform to bring transparency to the water distribution policies. A platform for agreement on clear rules that will dictate how water will be distributed - based on science and engineering, not short-term political interest and at a Global scale.
